# CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions and Terraform

## Overview
This project implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions and Terraform. The pipeline automates the testing, building, and deployment of infrastructure as code (IaC) managed by 
 Terraform.

- Automated Testing: GitHub Actions triggers automated tests upon every code push, ensuring code quality and reliability.
- Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform is used to define and provision infrastructure resources, such as compute instances, networks, and storage.
- Infrastructure Deployment: GitHub Actions automates the deployment of Terraform-managed infrastructure, enabling rapid and consistent implementations.
- Environment Isolation: The pipeline supports the creation of isolated environments for development, staging, and production, ensuring a controlled deployment process.
- Version Control Integration: The entire pipeline is integrated with version control using GitHub, providing visibility into changes and facilitating collaboration among team members.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub Repository: Create a GitHub repository to host the Terraform configuration files and GitHub Actions workflows.
- Terraform: Install Terraform locally or configure a CI/CD runner with Terraform installed to execute Terraform commands.
- Service Account: Create a service account with the necessary permissions to provision and manage resources on the target cloud provider.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the Terraform backend to store state files securely. (Optional)
3. Define the Terraform configuration files to provision infrastructure resources.
4. Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automate the CI/CD pipeline:
    - Define workflows for testing, building, and deploying infrastructure.
    - Configure environment-specific workflows for different deployment stages.
5. Create secrets in the GitHub repository for sensitive information such as API keys and access tokens.
6. Commit and push changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
7. Monitor the pipeline execution and review logs for any errors or failures.
8. Access deployed infrastructure resources and verified functionality.

## Workflow Structure
- `.github/workflows/`: This directory contains YAML files defining GitHub Actions workflows.
- `terraform/`: This directory contains Terraform configuration files (*.tf) and modules used to provision infrastructure resources.
- `scripts/`: This directory contains shell scripts used in the CI/CD pipeline, such as Terraform initialization and deployment scripts.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter errors during the pipeline execution, please check the logs and error messages for details.
- Verify that Terraform versions are compatible with the configured providers and modules.
- Ensure that the service account credentials and access permissions are correctly configured.
- Review Terraform configuration files for syntax errors and misconfigurations.
